==============

1) Create low-res frames from videos
    - Use the split script
2) Convert existing high-res pre-processed frames to low-res if need be
    - Use the downsample script
3) Set the desired output camera location and orientation
4) Change the output size of DepthMeshRenderer to match desired output resolution,
and rebuild
5) Call the script
    ./build/ReplicaSDK/DepthMeshRenderer ./assets/cafeteria_down/cafeteria_down <output_file_name> y y
OR
    ./build/ReplicaSDK/DepthMeshRenderer ./assets/cafeteria_down/cafeteria_down <output_file_name> y n
For perspective rendering
6) Generate equivalent output from ODS video frames using our method
    a) Generate low-res frames
    b) Set camera pose
    c) Get output

Naive mesh-based re-rendering
=============================
1) Include DepthMeshLib.h in data generation script
2) Generate a quad with which to perform depth mesh rendering (see the depth_mesh_viewer.cpp or depth_mesh_render.cpp files)
3) Create a depth mesh object for each new example
    - Do this after the normal image files for this example have been written
    - Use the second constructor, giving as input the textures corresponding to ERP color, ERP depth for the base position
    - Render the mesh from the offset position
    - Write the color to an output file -- should look similar to the offset position ground truth frame
4) When evaluating our method
    - Additionally compare these new frames from naive mesh-based re-rendering to the ground truth
